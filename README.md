# ExerQ 
## Overview
People may not have time to look for specific exercise routines that match their needs. The primary goal of this project is to provide a responsive workout routine query tool that is adapted to specific user requirements. This application will include a user-friendly interface where users may enter their desired workout duration and choose the type of exercises they want to do based on characteristics such as difficulty level, available equipment, and specific areas of interest. 

The application will use a dynamic database of exercises to provide real-time updates and individualized recommendations. Users can refine their search by changing the criteria, ensuring that the proposed routines match their particular tastes. Additionally, users will be able to create a free account to remember their favorite training exercises, allowing for a more personalized fitness experience.

## Objectives
We, as a team, are working to become comfortable with DevSecOps tools, principles, and practices, such as using GitHub to create a project repository and learning about Github Actions (YAML), CircleCi, AWS, and the SQLite database management system. 
These group objects are intended to ensure a smooth and effective workflow. 

## Tools
- Using GitHub to create a project repository allows us to manage our codebase more efficiently. It supports version control, allowing numerous collaborators to work on the project concurrently without overwriting each other’s modifications. The repository also functions as a backup and primary destination for all of our project’s code and documentation. 
- GitHub Actions is a sophisticated CI/CD solution that automates operations based on GitHub repositories. Learning GitHub Actions allows us to automate operations such as code testing, building, and deployment. This ensures that our code is consistently tested and deployed, which reduces manual errors and increases productivity. 
- CircleCI is another CI/CD tool that works with GitHub to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes. It offers more advanced customization and scalability possibilities. CircleCI allows you to ensure that your code is continuously checked and delivered, resulting in high code quality and reliability.
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a diverse set of cloud services to help our web app project. AWS enables us to easily deploy our application to a production environment while maintaining scalability, availability, and security. AWS also provides services like AWS CodeDeploy, which automates deployments and manages application updates easily. 
- SQLite is a lightweight and efficient database management system that is well-suited for online applications. It allows us to store and manage application data without the requirement for a separate database server. SQLite is simple to set up and use, making it ideal for rapid development and testing. 


## Process
**Web Application Development**
 To create our web application we will use HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

**GitHub Automation for CI/CD**
As we continue to make updates to the main branch in the project repository, it will trigger a build process to deploy the changes to AWS to then be delivered to our web application.

**AWS for Cloud Deployments**
The web server will be hosted on AWS.
